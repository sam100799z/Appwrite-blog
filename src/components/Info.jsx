            Chronique is a blog application project where users can upload and manage blogs. It is built with React.js for the frontend and Appwrite for backend services. Appwrite provides features like authentication, database management, and secure file storage. The app uses Redux Toolkit (RTK) for efficient state management, making the application faster and more scalable.

This application is coded in React.js for the frontend.Unlike simpler React + API projects, this app is more complex as it integrates backend services such as authentication, database management, and file storage. While the backend isnâ€™t written by me, using Appwrite allowed me to focus on building the frontend.",
